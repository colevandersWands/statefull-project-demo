## [Statefull Demo Project](https://janke-learning.github.io/statefull-demo-project)

Building a project like this is a challenge for a first year of study, or a reasonable expectation for part-way through a second year.  None of the individual functions are overly challenging while the entirety of the project requires a meaningful mastery of organized development, applied computation, inspecting & debugging, documentation, and attention to a (almost) fun user experience.  

Additionally students learn about data modeling, how applications are built of interactions around modeled & stored data.  This understanding is foundational to further progress in applied computing, data sciences, application development, and basic understanding of digitalization.

Besides the direct learning objectives of this project, students are gaining experience working in the open-source environment, using professional tools at a manageable level, and can immediately share their projects online.
